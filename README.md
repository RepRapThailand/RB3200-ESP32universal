## Features

- all ESP32-WROOM-32 pins are populated to 4 pin headers each
    - pin headers closest to the ESP32 module are directly exposed
    - pin headers further from the module are protected by a serial 180R
      resistor - so you can attach e.g. a LED directly or you don't have to
      worry if you accidentally switch you grounded input to output.
    - each pin has its own 5V, 3V3 and GND pin
- Arduino Uno compatible header
- USB2Serial chip for easy button-less programming
- support for external power supply with high-current voltage regulator
- diagnostic LEDs
